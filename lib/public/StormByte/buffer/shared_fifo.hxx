     * @class SharedFIFO
     * @brief Thread-safe FIFO built on top of @ref FIFO.
     *
     * @par Overview
     *  SharedFIFO wraps the non-thread-safe @ref FIFO with a mutex and a
     *  condition variable to provide safe concurrent access from multiple
     *  producer/consumer threads. It preserves the byte-oriented ring-buffer
     *  semantics of @ref FIFO while adding blocking behavior for reads and
     *  extracts.
     *
     * @par Blocking semantics
     *  - @ref Read(std::size_t) blocks until the requested number of bytes are
     *    available from the current non-destructive read position, or until
     *    the FIFO is closed via @ref Close(). If @c count == 0, it returns
     *    immediately with all bytes available from the current read position.
     *  - @ref Extract(std::size_t) blocks until at least @c count bytes exist
     *    in the buffer (destructive), or until closed. If @c count == 0, it
     *    returns immediately with all available data and clears the buffer.
     *
     * @par Close behavior
     *  @ref Close() marks the FIFO as closed and notifies all waiting threads.
     *  Subsequent calls to @ref Write() are ignored. Waiters will wake and
     *  complete using whatever data is presently available (which may be none).
     *
     * @par Seek behavior
     *  @ref Seek() updates the internal non-destructive read position and
     *  notifies waiters so blocked readers can re-evaluate their predicates
     *  relative to the new position.
     *
     * @par Thread safety
     *  All public member functions of SharedFIFO are thread-safe. Methods that
     *  mutate internal state (Write/Extract/Clear/Close/Seek/Reserve) acquire
     *  the internal mutex. Read accessors also acquire the mutex to maintain
     *  consistency with the current head/tail/read-position state.
