 * @namespace Buffer

     * @class Consumer
     * @brief Read-only interface for consuming data from a shared FIFO buffer.
     *
     * @par Overview
     *  Consumer provides a read-only interface to a SharedFIFO buffer.
     *  Multiple Consumer instances can share the same underlying buffer,
     *  allowing multiple consumers to read data concurrently in a thread-safe manner.
     *  Consumers can only be created through a Producer instance.
     *
     * @par Thread safety
     *  All read operations are thread-safe as they delegate to the underlying
     *  SharedFIFO which is fully thread-safe. Multiple consumers can safely
     *  read from the same buffer concurrently.
     *
     * @par Blocking behavior
     *  - @ref Read() blocks until the requested number of bytes are available
     *    or the buffer becomes unreadable (closed or error). If count is 0, returns
     *    all available data from the current read position without blocking.
     *  - @ref Extract() blocks until the requested number of bytes are available
     *    or the buffer becomes unreadable (closed or error). If count is 0, returns
     *    all available data immediately and clears the buffer.
     *
     * @par Producer-Consumer relationship
     *  Consumer instances cannot be created directly. They must be obtained from
     *  a Producer using Producer::Consumer(). This ensures proper buffer sharing
     *  between producers and consumers.
     *
     * @see Producer
