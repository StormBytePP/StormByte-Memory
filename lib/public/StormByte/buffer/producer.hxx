     * @par Overview
     *  Producer provides a write-only interface to a SharedFIFO buffer.
     *  Multiple Producer instances can share the same underlying buffer,
     *  allowing multiple producers to write data concurrently in a thread-safe manner.
     *
     * @par Thread safety
     *  All write operations are thread-safe as they delegate to the underlying
     *  SharedFIFO which is fully thread-safe.
