	 * @class FIFO
	 * @brief Byte-oriented ring buffer with grow-on-demand.
	 *
	 * @par Overview
	 *  A circular buffer implemented atop @c std::vector<std::byte> that tracks
	 *  head/tail indices and current size. It grows geometrically to fit writes
	 *  and supports efficient reads even across wrap boundaries.
	 *
	 * @par Thread safety
	 *  This class is **not thread-safe**. For concurrent access, use @ref SharedFIFO.
	 *
	 * @par Buffer behavior
	 *  The constructor-requested capacity is remembered and restored by @ref Clear().
	 *  When empty, an rvalue write adopts storage wholesale to avoid copies.
	 *  Reading the entire content when it is contiguous (head == 0) uses a
	 *  zero-copy fast path via move semantics.
	 *
	 * @see SharedFIFO for thread-safe version
	 * @see Producer and Consumer for higher-level producer-consumer pattern
