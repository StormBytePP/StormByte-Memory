	 * @brief Byte-oriented ring buffer with grow-on-demand.
	 * @par Overview
	 *  A circular buffer implemented atop @c std::vector<std::byte> that tracks
	 *  head/tail indices and current size. It grows geometrically to fit writes
	 *  and supports efficient reads even across wrap boundaries.
	 * @par Buffer behavior
	 *  The constructor-requested capacity is remembered and restored by @ref Clear().
	 *  When empty, an rvalue @ref Write(std::vector<std::byte>&&) adopts storage
	 *  wholesale to avoid copies. Reading the entire content when it is contiguous
	 *  (head == 0) uses a zero-copy fast path via move.
