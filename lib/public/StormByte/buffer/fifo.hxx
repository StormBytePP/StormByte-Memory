	 * @class FIFO
	* @brief Byte-oriented FIFO buffer with grow-on-demand.
	 *
	 * @par Overview
	*  A contiguous growable buffer implemented atop @c std::deque<std::byte> that tracks
	*  a logical read position. It grows automatically to fit writes and supports
	*  efficient non-destructive reads and destructive extracts.
	 *
	 * @par Thread safety
	 *  This class is **not thread-safe**. For concurrent access, use @ref SharedFIFO.
	 *
	 * @par Buffer behavior
	*  The buffer supports clearing and cleaning operations, a movable read position
	*  for non-destructive reads, and a closed state to signal end-of-writes.
	 *
	 * @see SharedFIFO for thread-safe version
	 * @see Producer and Consumer for higher-level producer-consumer pattern
